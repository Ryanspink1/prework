**Day One Questions:**
* What does pwd stand for, and how is this command helpful?
* A: pwd stands for "print working directory". It is useful as it outputs the name of your current directory.
* What does hostname tell you, and what shows up in YOUR terminal when you type hostname?
* A: Hostname shows your computers network name. My hostname is "Ryans-MacBook-Pro.local"


### Task F- Learn Ruby:

#### Option 1 Questions:
**IRB**
* How do you start and stop irb?
* A: irb is started by typing "irb" into the command line. It's stopped by typing "exit" into the command line. 
* What might you use irb for?
* A: irb is used for running Ruby code within the terminal. 

**Variables**
* How do you create a variable?
* A: variables are created by assigning a value to a name.
* What did you learn about the rules for naming variables?
* A: variables cannot have the value of letters, number variables cannot have a value other than their own, spaces in variable names must use an underscore not a dash, cannot have letters and numbers as the variable value, cannot have an integer start the name of a variable, can have an integer in the variable name though, 
* How do you change the value of a variable?
* A: The value of the variable can be changed by reassignign a new value to the name ie. " abalone = 6" can be changed with " abalone = 7"

**Datatypes**
* How can you find out the class of a variable?
* A: Type in the variable with ".class" proceeding it. 
* What are two string methods?
* A: partition and unpack are two string methods
* How can you change an integer to a string?
* A: integer.to_s

**Strings**
* Why might you use double quotes instead of single quotes in Ruby?
* A: To eliminate confusion when using lots of quotations?
* What is this used for in Ruby: #{}?
* A: This is used for interpolation
* How would you remove all the vowels from a string?
* A: All the vowels in a string can be removed by: "a string".delete('aeiou')

**Input & Output**
* What do 'print' and 'puts' do in Ruby?
* A: 'Puts' prints information to the user of the program. 'Print' does the same thing, but doesn't start a new line after.
* What does 'gets' do in Ruby?
* A: 'gets' retrieves the value that was entered by the user
* Add a screenshot in the comments of the program you created that uses 'puts' and 'gets', and give it the title, "I/O".

**Numbers & Arithmetic**
* What is the difference between integers and floats?
* A: integers are whole numbers, floats can contain decimels/fractions of numbers
* Complete the challenge, and post a screenshot of your program in the comments with the title, "Numbers".

**Booleans**
* What do each of the following symbols mean?
  + == equals
  + >= more than or equal to
  + <= less than or equal to
  + != opposite of
  + && and
  + || or
* What are two Ruby methods that return booleans?
* A: Two Ruby methods that return booleans are ".include?" and ".nil?"

**Conditionals**
* What is flow control?
* A: Flow control is using the program to make decisions for you using "if" "else" and "end" to construct a statement.
* What will the following code return?
```
apple_count = 4

if apple_count > 5
  puts "Lots of apples!"
else
  puts 'Not many apples...'
end
```
* A: The code returns "Not many apples..."
* What is an infinite loop, and how can you get out of one?
* A: An infinite loop is when the loop body doesn't do anything to make the loop condition false...running on forever. One can get out of this situation by typing "control+c" to terminate the program.
* Take a screenshot of your program and terminal showing two different outputs, and post it in the comments with the title, "Conditionals".

**nil**
* What is nil?
* A: "Nil is a special ruby type data that means "nothing" "
* Take a screenshot of your terminal after working through Step 4, and post it in the comments with the title, "nil".

**Symbols**
* How can symbols be beneficial in Ruby?
* A: Symbols can be beneficial in Ruby by using memory more efficiently.
* Does naming symbols use the same rules for naming variables?
* A: Symbols don't use the same rules. Instead of creating a new object ID, it allows the user to give the same symbol the same object ID, thus saving memory. 
* Take a screenshot of your terminal after working through Step 4, and post it in the comments with the title, "Symbols".

**Arrays**
* What method can you call to find out how many elements are in an array?
* A: The method to find out how many elements are in an array is '"array".length'
* What is the index of pizza in this array: ["pizza", "ice cream", "cauliflower"]?
* A: The index of pizza in this array is "0"
* What do 'push' and 'pop' do?
* A: Push adds an element at the end of an array, pop removes the element at the end of an array.

**Hashes**
* Describe some differences between arrays and hashes.
* A: Arrays store ordered lists of items, hashes store properties of objects. In such, Arrays store things based on keys, and hashes store will store as a pair of a key and a value. 
* What is a case when you might prefer an array? What is a case when you might prefer a hash?
* A: One might prefery an array when you want to store an ordered list of items. A Hash might be preferable when one wants to store keys with values. 
* * Take a screenshot of your terminal after working through Step 2, and post it in the comments with the title, "Hashes".

### Task G- Prework Reflection:
